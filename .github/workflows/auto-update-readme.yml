  # This workflow uses the pull_request trigger which prevents write permissions on the
  # GH_TOKEN and secrets access from public forks.  This should remain as a pull_request
  # trigger to protect org-level secrets which are utilized when the workflow automatically
  # updates the readme with the latest version changes in branches.  The reduced permissions
  # for public forks is adequate but does mean re-compiles and readme changes will have to
  # be made manually when the PR comes from a fork.
  pull_request:
  # Don't include any specific paths here so we always get a build that produces a status
  # check that our Branch Protection Rules can use.  Having a status check also allows us
  # to require that branches be up to date before they are merged.
